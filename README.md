<a name="installation"></a>
## 1 - Installation Instructions

This section provides a comprehensive guide on how to set up the project on your local machine.

### 1.1 - Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab

### 1.2 - Dependencies

The project relies on several Python libraries which are essential for running the notebook. Below is a list of the libraries:
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting graphs.
- `h5py`: For handling HDF5 files, commonly used to store large datasets.
- `scipy`: For scientific and technical computing, including optimization and integration.
- `PIL`: Python Imaging Library, used here for image processing.

### 2.1 - Running the Notebook

To use this project, you'll be running a Jupyter Notebook. Follow these steps:

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open the notebook file:
   - Navigate to the cloned repository and open `Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_mindset.ipynb`.

3. Execute the cells sequentially:
   - Each cell builds upon the previous one, so it's important to run them in order.

### 2.2 - Example Usage

This project implements logistic regression using a neural network mindset, structured into several sections:

1. **Packages**: All necessary packages are imported, and Jupyter magic commands are used to enable autoreloading of modules.
  
2. **Overview**: An overview of logistic regression and how it can be implemented with a neural network approach.

3. **General Architecture**: Explanation of the architecture and flow of the logistic regression model.

4. **Helper Functions**: Functions that are critical for various steps in the algorithm, such as sigmoid computation, initializing parameters, and computing gradients.

5. **Optimization**: The core part where the optimization (gradient descent) is implemented.

6. **Model Assembly**: The parts are combined to form a complete logistic regression model.

7. **Further Analysis**: Additional exploration such as tuning the learning rate to improve the model.
